- 👋 Hi, I’m @Karim-AbouelNaga
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development using React. I am also eager to learn new frameworks, currently I am picking up Vue.JS to further extending my knowledge regarding front-end technologies. Further down the line, I would also love to get more into full-stack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Zurich with a major in Software Systems and a minor in Data Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool idea for web apps!
- 📫 How to reach me send me a dm here on GH!
